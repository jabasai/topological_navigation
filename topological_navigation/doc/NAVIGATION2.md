# navigation2.py: Map-Driven Topological Navigation Server

This document describes the ROS 2 node implemented in `topological_navigation/scripts/navigation2.py`, including how it interacts with the rest of the topological navigation stack.

## Purpose

`navigation2.py` is the execution engine for topological navigation:

- Accepts high-level goals (`GotoNode`, `ExecutePolicyMode`)
- Plans graph routes using NetworkX
- Converts route edges into executable action segments
- Dynamically builds Nav2 action goals from map-defined templates
- Executes each segment through ROS 2 `ActionClient`s
- Publishes route, status, edge, boundary, and timing telemetry

The script is **map-driven**: action behavior, action server bindings, and behavior tree templates come from the topological map YAML (`definitions` + `actions` sections).

---

## Runtime Context in the Stack

`navigation2.py` depends on two upstream nodes at startup:

1. **Map manager (`map_manager2.py`)**
   - Publishes `/topological_map_2` (latched / transient local)
   - Provides the full map content used to build route graph and action config

2. **Localisation (`localisation2.py`)**
   - Publishes `closest_node`, `current_node`, `closest_edges` (latched)
   - Supplies robot topological position and closest-edge heuristic input

Typical launch order (see `launch/topological_navigation.launch.py`): map manager -> localisation -> navigation server.

- `closest_node` (`std_msgs/String`, transient local)
- `closest_edges` (`topological_navigation_msgs/ClosestEdges`, transient local)
- `current_node` (`std_msgs/String`, transient local)

## Publishers

- `topological_navigation/Statistics` (`topological_navigation_msgs/NavStatistics`, latched)
- `topological_navigation/Route` (`topological_navigation_msgs/TopologicalRoute`, best effort)
- `current_edge` (`std_msgs/String`, latched)

## Service client

- `/<goal_checker_node>/set_parameters` (`rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters`)
  - Used to push per-segment ROS 2 parameters (goal tolerances, action
    parameters) and restore previous values after segment completion
- `/<goal_checker_node>/get_parameters` (`rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters`)
  - Used to query current ROS 2 parameter values so they can be saved and
    restored around each segment

---

## Main Lifecycle

### 1) Construction and state initialization

`TopologicalNavServer` initializes:

- State machine (`NavStateMachine`) from `navigation_graph.py`
- Internal map/graph buffers (`_tmap`, `_graph`, pending map update buffer)
- Runtime flags (cancel/preempt/goal reached)
- QoS profiles (`_latch`, `_best`)
- Route/status/statistics publishers

### 2) Blocking wait for first map

The node subscribes to `/topological_map_2` and blocks until first map arrives.

On first map application:

- YAML parsed with `_FloatSafeLoader`
- Graph built via `build_graph_from_tmap()` (from `networkx_utils.py`)
- Map ID fields cached (`_topol_map`)
- Map-driven action configuration loaded (`_load_map_config`)

### 3) Build map-driven action clients

From map `actions` section:

- Dynamically imports each `action_type`
- Creates/reuses `ActionClient`s by `action_server`
- Resolves behavior tree template references (`${definitions.<name>}` -> temp XML file)

Result: `self._action_clients[action_name] = {client, action_class, config}`.

### 4) Blocking wait for localisation

Subscribes to `closest_node` and blocks until first localisation message.

Then subscribes to `closest_edges` and `current_node` for continuous updates.

### 5) Action servers become READY

Creates both action servers and transitions state machine to `READY`.

## Route Planning and Execution Flow

Before either action entry point can plan or execute a route, the robot pose
must be available in the coarse main-map frame and occupy a known-free (`0`)
cell in the published main occupancy grid. Unknown (`-1`), occupied (`100`),
and out-of-grid positions are outside. This check fails closed: the server
does not plan a route, generate `/topo_map_route_segment`, or send a Nav2 goal
when the pose cannot be proven to be inside the main map. The latched operation
status is set to `OUTSIDE_MAIN_MAP`, `ROBOT_POSE_UNAVAILABLE`, or
`MAIN_MAP_UNAVAILABLE`, as appropriate.

## Goal entry points

- `GotoNode`: plan from current estimated origin to target
- `ExecutePolicyMode`: execute caller-provided route (after sanity checks)

## Origin determination

`_determine_origin(target)` priority:

1. `current_node` if known
2. Closest-edge heuristic if edge distance <= `max_dist_to_closest_edge`
3. `closest_node`

For equal-distance dual edges, compares route distance from candidate sources.

## Route planning

Uses `plan_route()` from `navigation_graph.py` with parameters:

- `route_algorithm`: `astar` (default) or `dijkstra`
- `route_weight_attr`: edge attribute used as cost (default `weight`)

## Segment generation

From planned nodes:

1. `get_route_edges()` to expand node list into edge dicts
2. `merge_action_segments()` to group consecutive compatible edges
   - Controlled by map action config `composable`
   - Edges with empty or absent `properties` are *transparent*: they merge freely
     into any segment regardless of that segment's parameters
   - Two edges that each carry different non-empty `properties` force a split,
     ensuring each resulting segment has a consistent parameter set

## Segment execution

For each segment:

- Transition to action-specific execution state (`ACTION_TO_STATE`)
- Publish boundary polygon when boundary properties exist
- Apply ROS 2 parameters at segment entrance and restore them after exit (`_apply_segment_parameters` / `_restore_segment_parameters`)
- Build goal dynamically from map template (`_build_segment_goal`)
- Dispatch goal with `_send_nav2_goal`
- Publish move status + nav statistics
- Fail/cancel handling updates state machine and feedback
- Parameters are restored in a `try/finally` block, so they are always
  undone regardless of segment outcome (success, failure, cancellation)

---

## Mid-Navigation Map Updates

`navigation2.py` supports runtime map updates with deferred application:

- Incoming map messages are buffered (`_pending_map_msg`)
- If robot is navigating, update is postponed to safe points (between segments)
- At safe point, `_apply_pending_map()` rebuilds graph/config
- Remaining route validity checked by `_validate_remaining_route()`

If remaining nodes/edges no longer exist:

- Current execution returns `False`
- `_map_updated_during_nav` is set
- `_navigate()` triggers a full replan from current situation

This design avoids mutating route structures while a segment is in flight.

---

## Boundary Polygon Behavior

Boundary publishing is delegated to `compute_boundary_polygon()` in `navigation_graph.py`.

Trigger condition:

- Any edge in segment contains `properties.boundary_left` or `properties.boundary_right`

Behavior:

- Computes corridor polygon around segment waypoints
- Publishes to `/boundary_checker` in node nav frame
- Publishes empty polygon when no boundary applies (clears stale boundary)

Defaults controlled by parameters:

- `default_boundary_left`
- `default_boundary_right`

---

## Map Schema Expectations Relevant to navigation2.py

Although validation is performed upstream in map manager, `navigation2.py` expects:

- `nodes[*].node.name`
- `nodes[*].node.pose.{position,orientation}`
- `nodes[*].node.edges[*].{edge_id,node,action}`
- `actions` dictionary with per-action config
- Optional `definitions` dictionary for inline BT XML
- Optional `navigation_config_file` path pointing at a second YAML file
  that contains the top-level `definitions` and `actions` sections
- `transformation.topo_frame_id` (or fallback) for pose frame defaults

The recommended sidecar name is `topological_navigation_config.yaml`. It can
be referenced from the map with `navigation_config_file` or passed explicitly
to launch/CLI tools with `navigation_config_file` /
`--navigation-config-file`. Relative sidecar paths are resolved against the
main map file.

Action config shape (typical):

```yaml
actions:
  navigate_to_pose:
    action_type: nav2_msgs.action.NavigateToPose
    action_server: /navigate_to_pose
    composable: false
    action_goal_template:
      pose:
        header:
          frame_id: ${node.nav_frame}
        pose: ${node.pose}
      behavior_tree: ${definitions.default_bt}
```

The optional `ros_parameters` key in an action config maps **edge property
names** to **ROS 2 parameter names** on the goal-checker node.  When a segment
is entered the navigation server reads the current parameter values, applies the
values from the segment's edge properties, and restores the originals after the
segment exits — regardless of whether the segment succeeded, failed, or was
cancelled.

```yaml
actions:
  row_traversal:
    composable: true
    action_type: nav2_msgs.action.NavigateThroughPoses
    action_server: /navigate_through_poses
    ros_parameters:
      # edge property name → ROS 2 parameter path on goal_checker_node
      max_speed: FollowPath.max_robot_speed
    action_goal_template:
      poses:
        - header:
            frame_id: ${node.nav_frame}
          pose: ${node.pose}
      behavior_tree: ${definitions.row_traversal_bt}
```

With this config, an edge that carries `properties: {max_speed: 0.3}` will
cause the server to set `FollowPath.max_robot_speed = 0.3` before executing the
segment and restore the previous value afterwards.

Edge `properties` are optional on every edge.  Edges without properties (or
with empty properties `{}`) are *transparent* from a parameter perspective —
they inherit the effective parameters of the segment they are merged into.  This
means you only need to set parameters on the **first edge of an aisle** and they
will apply for the entire aisle segment:

```yaml
# Entry edge – carries the speed limit for the whole aisle
- edge_id: N3_N4
  action: row_traversal
  node: N4
  properties:
    max_speed: 0.3   # applied for the whole N3→N4→N5 segment

# Subsequent edge – no properties, inherits max_speed: 0.3
- edge_id: N4_N5
  action: row_traversal
  node: N5
  # properties: {}  (absent or empty — transparent)
```

---

## Dynamic ROS 2 Parameter Binding

`navigation2.py` applies two categories of ROS 2 parameters at segment
entrance and restores them after exit.

### Node-level goal tolerances

If the **target node** of a segment carries `xy_goal_tolerance` or
`yaw_goal_tolerance` in its `properties`, those values are pushed to the
goal-checker node before the segment executes:

```yaml
nodes:
  - node:
      name: TightDockingNode
      properties:
        xy_goal_tolerance: 0.02
        yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.01
```

The node-level parameters that receive these values are configurable:

- `xy_tolerance_param` (default `goal_checker.xy_goal_tolerance`)
- `yaw_tolerance_param` (default `goal_checker.yaw_goal_tolerance`)

### Edge-level action parameters

Any edge property listed in an action's `ros_parameters` map is pushed before
the segment runs.  The mapping is `{edge_property_name: ros2_param_name}`.
Only properties actually present in the segment's effective parameters (see
segment merging rules) are applied.

### Save / restore guarantee

Before any parameter is changed, its current value is queried via
`GetParameters`.  After the segment exits (in a `try/finally`), the saved
values are restored via `SetParameters`.  Both operations are best-effort:
if the parameter service is unavailable the segment still executes with the
currently configured values and no restoration is attempted.

## Module Interaction Details

## With `networkx_utils.py`

- `build_graph_from_tmap()` provides normalized graph attributes used by planner and goal builders:
  - Node coordinates, orientation, properties, `nav_frame`
  - Edge metadata (`edge_id`, `action`, `action_type`, `properties`, `weight`)

`navigation2.py` relies on these attributes for:

- shortest-path planning
- route edge extraction
- dynamic pose generation
- frame resolution
- property-based tolerances

## With `navigation_graph.py`

Directly uses:

- `NavState`, `NavStateMachine`, `ACTION_TO_STATE`
- `plan_route()`
- `get_route_edges()`
- `merge_action_segments()`
- `compute_boundary_polygon()`
- `get_route_distance()`

This module holds most pure planning/state logic; `navigation2.py` orchestrates ROS I/O and action execution.

## With `tmap_utils.py`

Uses:

- `get_node_from_tmap2()` as fallback when graph-based node lookup fails
- `get_edge_from_id_tmap2()` for policy-mode route edge resolution and segment preflight

## With `localisation2.py`

Consumes localisation outputs:

- `closest_node` for route start fallback
- `current_node` for strongest origin evidence
- `closest_edges` for edge-based origin heuristic

If localisation is unavailable, server intentionally blocks during startup waiting for first message.

## With `map_manager2.py`

Depends on `/topological_map_2` as source of truth.

QoS compatibility is important:

- map manager publishes with transient local durability
- navigation server subscribes with transient local durability
- late joiner still receives latest map

---

## Concurrency and Thread Safety

Key mechanisms:

- `MultiThreadedExecutor`
- Reentrant callback groups for map and action servers
- `_map_lock` (`RLock`) protecting pending/current map mutation

Design choice:

- Nav2 futures are polled with `time.sleep()` in `_send_nav2_goal`
- avoids `spin_once()` conflict with external executor ownership

---

## Parameters

Declared and loaded in `_declare_parameters()` / `_load_parameters()`:

- `max_dist_to_closest_edge` (double, default `1.0`)
- `default_boundary_left` (double, default `0.5`)
- `default_boundary_right` (double, default `0.5`)
- `route_algorithm` (string, `astar`|`dijkstra`, default `astar`)
- `route_weight_attr` (string, default `weight`)
- `goal_checker_node` (string, default `controller_server`)
- `xy_tolerance_param` (string, default `goal_checker.xy_goal_tolerance`)
- `yaw_tolerance_param` (string, default `goal_checker.yaw_goal_tolerance`)

---

## Failure/Recovery Semantics

Common failure points and behavior:

- Missing target node -> immediate `FAILED`
- No route found -> immediate `FAILED`
- Action type import failure in map config -> action skipped/unavailable
- Nav2 server unavailable -> segment `FAILED`
- Mid-route map invalidates remaining path -> force replan
- Cancel/preempt -> propagate cancel to Nav2 and transition `CANCELLED`

Statistics are still published on failed segments when sufficient context exists.

---

## Extension Guide

Safe extension points:

1. **New edge action types**
   - Add action definition to map `actions`
   - Ensure `action_type` import path is valid
   - Provide compatible `action_goal_template`

2. **Custom route costs**
   - Add edge property used as weight
   - Set `route_weight_attr` accordingly

3. **Boundary behavior tuning**
   - Use edge properties `boundary_left/right`
   - or change default boundary parameters

4. **Goal tolerance policies**
   - Provide per-node tolerances in node `properties`
   - map to correct Nav2 parameter names via `xy_tolerance_param` / `yaw_tolerance_param`

5. **Dynamic ROS 2 parameters per segment**
   - Add a `ros_parameters` key to the relevant action config
   - Map edge property names to ROS 2 parameter paths on the goal-checker node
   - Set the desired property on the entry edge of each aisle / segment
   - Edges without properties are transparent and inherit the segment's values

---

## Backward Compatibility with Existing Topological Maps

This release is **fully backward compatible**.  Existing maps that do not use
edge `properties` or the `ros_parameters` action key will behave identically
to previous versions:

| Map feature | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Edges with no `properties` key | Treated as empty (`{}`); transparent — always merge with adjacent same-action edges |
| Edges with `properties: {}` | Same as above |
| Edges with `properties: null` | Normalised to `{}`; same as above |
| `ros_parameters` absent from action config | No dynamic parameters are applied or restored |
| Node `properties` without `xy_goal_tolerance` / `yaw_goal_tolerance` | No tolerance change |

**No changes to map YAML files are required.**

The only behaviour change relative to the *prior* implementation is that the
old `_set_goal_tolerances` / `_tolerance_set_cb` pair (which only set, never
restored) has been replaced by `_apply_segment_parameters` /
`_restore_segment_parameters`, which additionally saves the previous values and
restores them after each segment.  For maps that relied on goal tolerances
being *permanent* (i.e. set once and left) this means tolerances now reset to
their pre-segment values after each segment.  If you want a tolerance to
persist across segments, either set it identically on every relevant node or
configure it as the static default in your Nav2 controller configuration.

---

## Operational Tips

- If node hangs at startup, confirm latched map/localisation topics are present.
- If planning fails unexpectedly, verify edge directionality in map graph.
- If frame mismatches occur, check map `transformation.topo_frame_id`, node `nav_frame`, and Nav2 frame expectations.
- For policy execution, ensure route starts at current/closest node.
